### frost

An R package which contains a compilation of empirical methods used by farmers and agronomic engineers to predict the minimum temperature to detect a frost event. These functions use variables such as environmental temperature, relative humidity, and dew point.

The version 0.0.4 of frost is available on CRAN repository https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=frost
